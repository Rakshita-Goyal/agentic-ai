AI:pattern recognition,language ,image analysis,voice recognition
Ml is subset of AI
AI  has rule based system ,robotics,Ml,fuzzy,a*algo
ML has Deep Learning uses nueral networks (tranformers)
deep learning subset is generative AI(generate the audios videos)

ML:
supervised,unsupervised,reinforcement learning

supervised :y=f(x).  labelled in op 
:supervised has classification and regression 
classfication has binary value: spam ,non spam
and multi valued:positive,negative,neutral
regression: numerical time prediction 
like property price,stock price ,  x is independent variable,y is dependent variable
y=ax+b

unsupervised learning :unlabled raw data in clusters it is grouped based on similarity and build categories ,outlier and anamoly detection 
solves clustering and also association 
clustering :partition ,heirarchial,
association:market basket algo: basically relation between items

reinforcement learning:agent learns to make decision by interacting with an enviournment ,receving rewards and penalties for its action 
goal is to maximise the rewards 
like in chess 

deep learning is for non structured data more rather than using the statistatical methods
neural networks:made of layers
neraul network has neurons
there is input layer ,then one or more middle/hidden layers,output layer
each newron has bias number and we calculate the cost and measure the diffence between actual and determined output,forward propagation
and rectify the diffence by making changes during back propagation 
use pytorch ,tenser flow
typs of neural networks:
feed forward nn:single forward flow ,not for time dependent,sequential
recurrant nn:loops is used ,remembers the previous outcomes and use it to deduce output of current neuron, for sequential,for context. , stock or language prediction 
convolitional nn:for images ,videos in form of grid,   it redices the input size ,look small patch of the image and create a 
tranformers:sequential data, see the complete data and choose which part to focus on ,tokens are derived ,derive the attention score for each 
strong sense of meaning and context behind it 

Generative AI:Application of deep learning
eg:
text:gpt ,claude,gemini
images,audio,videos
code:code lama,github copilot

nlp and llm 
natural language processing :train to generate,undersatnd ,interpretate the human language
llm solves the nlp tasks
(large language models) 

computer vision :see and interpretate the images  uses cnn

llm:genai+nlp
