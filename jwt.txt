jwt is for authentication and authorization 
JWT (JSON Web Token) is a stateless authentication mechanism used to securely transmit information between client and server as a JSON object.
generates tokens
claim that the motion is allowed to occur
eg:
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.
eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiYWRtaW4iOnRydWUsImlhdCI6MTUxNjIzOTAyMn0.

first half is header shows which algo using 
second half is our message
third half is the signature

header decoded
{
  "alg": "HS256",//which also used for encryption and signature
  "typ": "JWT" //token tye 
}
payload data
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "iat": 1516239022
}
verify signature
a-string-secret-at-least-256-bits-long         //generate the private key

if someone has the token they will send he token the server decrypt with the private key and server let it use the resource 

tokens stored in local storrage,seesion storage or in the cookies
gets expired in some time

refresh token is used when the access token expire ,when this is sent then access token is regenerated

token vs session 
token is stateless so the things happen between the client and server and dont need the database each time the client makes the request
process:
client sends its Credentials servers checks from the database if registered or not 
now the server sends token to the client now every time it akes the request ,server decrypts it and things happen (crud operation where database is involved ) , refresh token concept also part of it

session:statefull 
client send the crdential server validate it via database information
then set session id cokkie by server in client/browser
same session id stored in the database also
when make the requestion send the session id with it and server will vaodate it using the database session id kept there
then one call for the crud happens
