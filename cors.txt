cors cross origin resource sharing 
CORS is a browser security rule that controls which websites are allowed to access resources from another website.

Same-Origin means:All three must match:
Protocol (http / https)
Domain
Port
If any one is different → cross-origin

Important CORS Headers
1️⃣ Access-Control-Allow-Origin
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://localhost:3000
✔ Allows this origin

Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
✔ Allows all (not safe for auth APIs)

2️⃣ Access-Control-Allow-Methods
GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

3️⃣ Access-Control-Allow-Headers
Content-Type, Authorization

4️⃣ Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
true(cookies)


Preflight Request:For unsafe requests (POST, PUT, DELETE,custom headers):
Browser sends an OPTIONS request first.
Preflight checks:
Is this origin allowed?
Is this method allowed?
Are these headers allowed?
Only then actual request is sent.
